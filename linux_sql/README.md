# Introduction

The Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration manages about 10 nodes each using the CentOS 7 Linux distribution. These nodes are also connected through a switch and are able to communicate using internal IPv4 addresses. The purpose of this project is to track and record the performance of each node as well as the resources each node uses. This data will be stored in an RDBMS database and used to generate reports for plans regarding future nodes.

# Quick Start



# Implementation

The project will be implemented with tools including but not limited to Linux command lines, Bash scripts, PostgreSQL, Docker, etc.. SQL queries will be used to retrieve data for requests.

## Architecture



## Scripts



## Database Modelling



# Testing

Ideally, the program should be tested on a Linux cluster of multiple machines. However, due to the limited resources available, such a test environment is unfeasible. Hence, the program will be tested on a single machine. It is our hope that testing the program in this environment will still ensure that it works in a cluster environment. The bash scripts will be tested and verified manually while query results generated by SQL scripts will be verified using our own test data.

# Deployment

The program will be scheduled using Crontab. We will manage the source code with Github and provision the database with Docker.

# Improvements
