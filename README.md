# Gabriel Chan . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated from University of Toronto, St. George campus as a Computer Science specialist. I studied a wide range of programming languages including Python, Java and C. I have also worked on many group projects with groups as large as 13 other peers.I've taken many Computer Science courses so I am familiar with a wide range of programming languages. I have also learned about many programming principles such as Object Oriented Programming as well as Software Development Life Cycles. I've also taken a handful of mathematics courses so I am familiar with some mathematical concepts like Calculus and Linear Algebra.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_GabrielChan](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_GabrielChan)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_GabrielChan/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration manages about 10 nodes each using the CentOS 7 Linux distribution. These nodes are also connected through a switch and are able to communicate using internal IPv4 addresses. The purpose of this project is to track and record the performance of each node as well as the resources each node uses. This data will be stored in an RDBMS database and used to generate reports for plans regarding future nodes.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_GabrielChan/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: This application, given a regular expression, a directory and an output file, will read each file in the given directory (including in sub-directories) and return lines that match the given regular expression. Notable classes that were used include the `Pattern` class for matching lines with regular expression as well as the `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter` and `nio.Files` class for reading and writing files. There is also a lambda implementation which focuses more on using lambda functions and the `Stream` class. The IntelliJ IDE was used to write this application and Docker was used for deployment.
  - JDBC App: This application interacts with a PostgreSQL database to perform CRUD operations. Java Database Connectivity provides the framework for interacting with the database. Operations are performed using the `JDBCExecutor` class and the Data Access Object outlined in `CustomerDAO`. Maven was used to help construct the project and install the necessary dependencies.


## Highlighted Projects
**Trash Panda Unity Project** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jialori/TrashPanda)]: Developed a Unity video game alongside 13 other peers including fellow developers, artists, animators and composers. The players takes the role of a raccoon mom causing as much damage as possible to a construction site in an effort to protect her children. I designed the artificial intelligence of enemies (construction workers) and designed a handful of UI elements.


## Professional Experiences
