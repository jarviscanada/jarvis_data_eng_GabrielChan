    description: "The Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration manages about 10 nodes each using the CentOS 7 Linux distribution. These nodes are also connected through a switch and are able to communicate using internal IPv4 addresses. The purpose of this project is to track and record the performance of each node as well as the resources each node uses. This data will be stored in an RDBMS database and used to generate reports for plans regarding future nodes."
  - name: "Twitter CRUD App"
    git_url: "/core_java/twitter"
    description: "The Twitter CRUD app accesses the user's Twitter account through a set of key and secret tokens and sends HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations using Twitter's REST API. This application allows the user to create, retrieve and delete Tweets using a command line interface. Core technologies used in the implementation of this application include, OAuth, Google GSON, Mockito, JUnit, Maven and Docker."

    description:
        - "Grep App: This application, given a regular expression, a directory and an output file, will read each file in the given directory (including in sub-directories) and return lines that match the given regular expression. Notable classes that were used include the `Pattern` class for matching lines with regular expression as well as the `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter` and `nio.Files` class for reading and writing files. There is also a lambda implementation which focuses more on using lambda functions and the `Stream` class. The IntelliJ IDE was used to write this application and Docker was used for deployment."
        - "JDBC App: This application interacts with a PostgreSQL database to perform CRUD operations. Java Database Connectivity provides the framework for interacting with the database. Operations are performed using the `JDBCExecutor` class and the Data Access Object outlined in `CustomerDAO`. Maven was used to help construct the project and install the necessary dependencies."
